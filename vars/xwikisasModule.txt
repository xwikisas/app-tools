Wraps the `xwikiModule` step, adding custom configuration specific to the XWiki SAS Paid Apps.

Main use case: simple maven modules with a single maven build. For more complex use cases, see documentation for the
[`xwikiBuild`](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-jenkins-pipeline) step, in which you'll also find the full list of
configuration options available.

Example usage:

```
xwikisasModule {
    goals = 'clean install'
}
```
